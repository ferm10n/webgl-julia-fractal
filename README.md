# WebGL-Julia-Fractal
Simple example of how to use WebGL and HTML5 to render a Julia fractal. Touch compatible!


I included documentation on how it sorta works. I'm by no means an expert on WebGL or fractals, so don't take my notes TOO seriously. A lot of the process was oversimplified in an attempt to reduce the hair pulling of future readers.

Basically I just tried to capture what I learned while making this awesome project. [Check it out live](https://jws121295.github.io/webgl-julia-fractal)

Enjoy.
